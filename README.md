# hermod

> Monitoring tool for Ark Core

This tool is based on the monitoring capabilities of [Noah](https://github.com/faustbrian/noah), but adjusted to work with v2 of Ark.

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/ItsANameToo/hermod.git
cd ~/hermod
bash hermod.sh install
bash hermod.sh start
```

That's it! Hermod is now monitoring your logs

## Configuration

After running `bash hermod.sh install`, there will be a `.hermod` file available where you can change the configuration to your preference.
At a minimum, you should go over and fill in some of the following configuration:

```bash
# Notification settings, by default these should be fine, but you can decide to increase / reduce it to your liking
monitor_lines=10
monitor_interval=1
monitor_sleep_after_notif=10

# Delegate info to properly filter the log messages. Both should be filled in with your delegate details.
delegate_username=''
delegate_public_key=''

# How you would like to be notified. Don't forget to change this line to one (or more) ways in which you would like to be updated.
notification_drivers=(log)  
```

There are a couple of services that you can use to get notified by the script.
These are currently the following:

* Discord, with the use of [webhooks](https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks)
* Slack, with the use of [webhooks](https://api.slack.com/incoming-webhooks)
* [Postfix](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-configure-postfix-on-ubuntu-16-04) (email)
